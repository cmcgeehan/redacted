## Monitoring

### How to Check RSVPs

**Option 1: Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to Supabase â†’ Table Editor
2. Select `mission_rsvps`
3. View all responses

**Option 2: API Endpoint**
Visit: `https://mission.gabyandconor.com/api/rsvp`

**Option 3: SQL Query**
```sql
SELECT operative_name, accepted_at
FROM mission_rsvps
ORDER BY accepted_at DESC;
```

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

1. **Vercel Deployment Issues**
   - Go to Vercel â†’ Deployments
   - Click "..." on previous working deployment
   - Select "Promote to Production"

2. **Database Issues**
   - Drop table: `DROP TABLE mission_rsvps;`
   - Re-run `SCHEMA.sql`

3. **DNS Issues**
   - Remove CNAME record
   - Wait for TTL expiration
   - Re-add with correct values

## Go-Live Timeline

Recommended timeline:
1. **T-7 days**: Deploy to Vercel
2. **T-5 days**: Configure subdomain
3. **T-3 days**: Test with friends
4. **T-2 days**: Final verification
5. **T-0**: Send invites! ðŸš€
